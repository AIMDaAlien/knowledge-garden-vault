## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Priority List

1. **Security First** (Do these immediately)
   - Disable WPS
   - Change default admin password
   - Disable TP-Link Cloud services
   - Configure custom DNS servers

2. **Performance Boost**
   - Enable Airtime Fairness
   - Optimize channel selection
   - Configure QoS settings
   - Enable MU-MIMO and Beamforming

3. **Clean Up**
   - Disable unnecessary ALG settings
   - Turn off unused services
   - Schedule automatic reboots

## ðŸ”‘ Key Principles

**Performance & Privacy aren't mutually exclusive** - A secure network often performs better because it's not wasting resources on unwanted traffic.

**Less is more** - Modern applications handle NAT better than router ALGs. Disable features you don't actively use.

**Document your changes** - Always backup router configuration after making changes.
