# GrapheneOS Migration Guide: From Verizon Hell to Privacy Success

## Executive Summary
This document chronicles a complete journey from attempting to install GrapheneOS on a carrier-locked device to successfully migrating to a functional privacy-focused setup. **Key lesson**: Carrier-locked devices are absolute blockers - always verify bootloader unlock capability before purchase.

## The Problem: Verizon Bootloader Lock

### Initial Situation
- **Device**: Pixel 6 Pro from carrier
- **Goal**: Install GrapheneOS for enhanced privacy
- **Obstacle**: Automatic eSIM detection suggested Verizon variant
- **Outcome**: Complete failure - Verizon devices cannot be unlocked

### Verizon Lock Investigation
**Critical Finding**: Verizon Pixel devices **cannot** be bootloader unlocked through any reliable method as of 2025.

**Technical Details**:
- Verizon locks bootloaders at factory via carrier ID in persist partition
- "OEM unlocking" toggle permanently grayed out
- No working exploits or workarounds exist
- Even Verizon customer service explicitly refuses unlock requests

**Failed "Solutions" Investigated**:
- Claims of "dirty pipe" exploit (patched/unreliable/risky)
- SIM unlocking ≠ bootloader unlocking for Verizon
- No developer has produced reproducible unlock method since Pixel 2 era

## The Pivot: Security Analysis Without GrapheneOS

When GrapheneOS proved impossible, we compared available security options:

### Stock Pixel 6 Pro (Android 16) vs OnePlus 12 (OxygenOS 15)

#### Security Comparison (60-point scale)
**Pixel 6 Pro Score: 51/60**

### Pre-Purchase Verification Protocol

#### Step 1: IMEI Verification (CRITICAL)
**Method 1 - Google's Official Tool**:
1. Go to `store.google.com/repair`
2. Click "Get Started" 
3. Enter IMEI number
4. Analyze results:
   - ✅ **GOOD**: Shows device info without "VZ"
   - ❌ **BAD**: Shows "VZ" (Verizon) = permanently locked
   - ❓ **UNCLEAR**: "Cannot determine warranty status"

**Method 2 - Physical Verification** (if buying in person):
1. Enable Developer Options (Settings → About → tap Build Number 7x)
2. Go to Settings → System → Developer Options → "OEM unlocking"
3. Results:
   - ✅ **UNLOCKABLE**: Toggle is available (can turn on/off)
   - ❌ **LOCKED**: Toggle grayed out with carrier message

#### Step 2: Model Number Verification
**Pixel 7 Pro Model Numbers**:
- ✅ **Unlocked Models**: GVU6C, GA03460-US
- ❌ **Verizon Model**: GE2AE (avoid completely)

#### Step 3: Damage Assessment for Used Devices
**Installation-Compatible Damage**:
- ✅ **Broken back glass**: Pure cosmetics, zero impact
- ✅ **Missing volume/power buttons**: ADB commands work around this
- ✅ **Minor screen cracks**: As long as touch works
- ✅ **Scratches/scuffs**: Irrelevant for functionality

**Deal Breakers**:
- ❌ **Damaged USB-C port**: Required for installation and charging
- ❌ **Non-responsive touchscreen**: Can't complete setup
- ❌ **Won't power on**: Obviously problematic
- ❌ **Water damage indicators**: Risk of hidden issues

## Implementation: GrapheneOS Installation

### Our Successful Case Study
**Device**: Pixel 7 Pro with broken back glass and missing volume buttons
**Purchase Cost**: ~50% reduction due to cosmetic damage
**Installation Time**: 30 minutes using web installer
**Result**: 100% success, full functionality

### Pre-Installation Preparation
1. **Enable Developer Options**: Settings → About → tap Build Number 7x
2. **Enable "OEM unlocking"**: Developer Options → OEM unlocking (toggle ON)
3. **Enable "USB debugging"**: Developer Options → USB debugging (toggle ON)
4. **Skip Google sign-in**: Everything gets wiped anyway

### Installation Process
**Primary Method**: GrapheneOS Web Installer
- **URL**: `grapheneos.org/install/web`
- **Browser**: Chrome (best WebUSB support, especially on macOS)
