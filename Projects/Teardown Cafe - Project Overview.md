# Teardown Cafe - Project Overview

## Vision
A public-facing website showcasing amateur device teardowns to help others learn from simple, accessible repair and exploration projects.

## Core Philosophy
- **Audience:** Fellow amateurs and curious beginners
- **Approach:** Simple insides, not deep technical dives
- **Content:** 1-5 photos per project showing teardown process
- **Style:** Accessible, educational, no gatekeeping

## Devices Covered
- **Monitors** (Dell U2415 documented)
- **Laptops** (ThinkPad T480 mentioned)
- **Smartphones**
- **Raspberry Pi builds** (Pi 5 NVMe build documented)
- **NAS builds**
- **Hardware mods**
- **3D printed functional items**
- **Mechanical keyboards**

## Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Astro.js (v5.14.5 as of Oct 2025)
- **Design System:** Material You 3 Expressive (dark mode)
- **Typography:** Ubuntu font family
- **Design Tool:** Figma with Dev Mode integration
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Hosting Target:** Vercel/Netlify (planned)

## Project Location
`/Users/aim/Documents/teardown-cafe/`

## Domain
teardown.cafe (available, ~$30/yr)

## Privacy Considerations
- EXIF data stripped from all images
- No location metadata
- Static site for minimal attack surface
- Privacy-friendly analytics planned (not yet implemented)

## Content Strategy
Photos uploaded in batches per project, maximum 20 photos total expected across all teardowns. Each teardown includes:
- Title and date
- Device category
- Difficulty rating (easy/medium/hard)
- Photo gallery with descriptions
- What was learned
- Tools used
- Recommendations
