# GrapheneOS Migration Guide: From Verizon Hell to Privacy Success

## Executive Summary
This document chronicles a complete journey from attempting to install GrapheneOS on a carrier-locked device to successfully migrating to a functional privacy-focused setup. **Key lesson**: Carrier-locked devices are absolute blockers - always verify bootloader unlock capability before purchase.

## The Problem: Verizon Bootloader Lock

### Initial Situation
- **Device**: Pixel 6 Pro from carrier
- **Goal**: Install GrapheneOS for enhanced privacy
- **Obstacle**: Automatic eSIM detection suggested Verizon variant
- **Outcome**: Complete failure - Verizon devices cannot be unlocked

### Verizon Lock Investigation
**Critical Finding**: Verizon Pixel devices **cannot** be bootloader unlocked through any reliable method as of 2025.

**Technical Details**:
- Verizon locks bootloaders at factory via carrier ID in persist partition
- "OEM unlocking" toggle permanently grayed out
- No working exploits or workarounds exist
- Even Verizon customer service explicitly refuses unlock requests

**Failed "Solutions" Investigated**:
- Claims of "dirty pipe" exploit (patched/unreliable/risky)
- SIM unlocking ≠ bootloader unlocking for Verizon
- No developer has produced reproducible unlock method since Pixel 2 era

## The Pivot: Security Analysis Without GrapheneOS

When GrapheneOS proved impossible, we compared available security options:

### Stock Pixel 6 Pro (Android 16) vs OnePlus 12 (OxygenOS 15)

#### Security Comparison (60-point scale)

2. Click "Get Started" 
3. Enter IMEI number
4. Analyze results:
   - ✅ **GOOD**: Shows device info without "VZ"
   - ❌ **BAD**: Shows "VZ" (Verizon) = permanently locked
   - ❓ **UNCLEAR**: "Cannot determine warranty status"

**Method 2 - Physical Verification** (if buying in person):
1. Enable Developer Options (Settings → About → tap Build Number 7x)
2. Go to Settings → System → Developer Options → "OEM unlocking"
3. Results:
   - ✅ **UNLOCKABLE**: Toggle is available (can turn on/off)
   - ❌ **LOCKED**: Toggle grayed out with carrier message

#### Step 2: Model Number Verification
**Pixel 7 Pro Model Numbers**:
