## Conversation Memory Context

### Collaboration Patterns Established

**What Worked Well:**
- Visual artifacts with periwinkle/lavender color schemes
- Skeptical questioning led to DDR4-3200 optimization
- Research-backed recommendations with web searches
- Honest assessment when initial recommendations were suboptimal
- Power-user focus rather than beginner explanations
- Security/privacy emphasized in every recommendation

**User's Decision-Making Style:**
- Highly capable deal-hunter (found i5-11400 for $190 vs quoted $280+)
- Values understanding "why" behind recommendations
- Practical learner through hands-on problem-solving
- Budget-conscious but quality-focused
- Self-sufficient with troubleshooting

### Japanese Vocabulary Introduced

Throughout this project, natural vocabulary integration:
- けちな (kechina) - Penny-pinching
- てんさい (tensai) - Genius  
- そんちょう (sonchō) - Respect
- じゅんび (junbi) - Preparation
- かくにん (kakunin) - Verification
- こうりつてき (kōritsu-teki) - Efficient

### Quick Context Markers for Future Reference

**Hardware identifiers:**
- "Your DDR4-3600 NAS build"
- "The i5-11400 system you found for $190"  
- "Your 8-drive RAID-Z2 setup"
- "The LSI 9207-8i HBA project"

**Technical context:**
- 11th gen Intel for DDR4-3200 support (89% RAM utilization)
- TrueNAS SCALE on 128GB NVMe
- 8x SAS drives in pool, 2 spares
- Status: Network configuration complete, system operational
