## Workflow Established

### Claude â†’ Cursor Division
- **Claude:** Architecture, specs, content creation, image optimization, strategy
- **Cursor:** Implementation from specs, component building, code execution

### Deployment
- **Platform:** Vercel (auto-deploys on `git push`)
- **Critical:** Always push to GitHub before expecting deployment updates
- **Vercel MCP:** Connected for Claude to trigger deploys and check status

### Image Optimization
- Original images: 10-15MB each
- Optimized: 400KB-1.4MB (95% reduction)
- Command: `sips -Z 1920 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 80`

## Tag System

Each teardown has 8-12 tags for automated Obsidian matching:
- **Device types:** laptop-repair, 3d-printing, nas-storage, smartphone-repair
- **Skills:** thermal-management, cable-management, opencore, zfs
- **Difficulty:** beginner-friendly, advanced-repair
- **Tech:** bambu-lab, raspberry-pi, truenas

Build script scans Obsidian vault, matches tags, generates relationships.

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Ready for Cursor Implementation
1. Vercel image optimization (install `@astrojs/vercel`)
2. Circuit accent hover fixes (darker glow in light mode)
3. Lavender background for light theme
4. Quick Looks page for single-photo items
5. Populate prints gallery with actual data

### Future Enhancements (Not Spec'd)
- Search functionality
- RSS feed
- View counter
- Open Graph images for social sharing
- Estimated read time on cards

## Git Status

**Latest Commit:** 078f10d (About page rewrite)  
**Branch:** main  
**Remote:** GitHub sync'd, Vercel deployed

## Key Learnings This Session

1. **Vercel deploys from GitHub, not local** - Always push first
2. **Cursor has smaller context** - Break tasks into smaller chunks, reference specific files
3. **Tag automation works** - Zero manual maintenance after setup
4. **Obsidian MCP** - Can create/update notes directly
5. **Privacy matters** - EXIF stripping, no tracking analytics
