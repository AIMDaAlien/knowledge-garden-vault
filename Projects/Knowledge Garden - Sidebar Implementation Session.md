# Knowledge Garden - Sidebar Implementation Session

## Problem Solved
Sidebar displayed file emoji overflow when folders collapsed - caused by CSS `::before` pseudo-elements with `opacity: 0` still rendering in DOM tree.

## Solution
Changed from `opacity: 0` to `display: none` for pseudo-elements, preventing render until hover/expansion.

## Floating Pill Sidebar Implementation
Successfully implemented Material 3 floating pill navigation from concept file:

### Features Added
- **Section labels** with fade-in animation
- **File count badges** on folders (e.g., "248 files")
- **Smooth morphing animations:**
  - Scale transforms (0.95x collapse, badge 0.8xâ†’1.0x)
  - slideIn keyframe for active indicators
  - translateX hover feedback (4px hover, 8px active)
  - Vertical slide + fade for notes lists
- **Enhanced pill styling:**
  - Gradient background layers
  - Left accent bar on active state
  - Bounce animation on icon hover
- **Motion:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` throughout

### Files Modified
- `garden-m3.css` - Added section labels, enhanced animations, morphing transitions
- `garden-m3.js` - Added "Folders" label, file count badges to sidebar

## Key Learning
**CSS pseudo-elements with `opacity: 0` remain in accessibility tree** - use `display: none` to prevent unwanted text node rendering in collapsed states.

## Next Steps
- Test across browsers
- Consider adding smooth scroll to active items
- Potential: Add drag-to-reorder for folders
