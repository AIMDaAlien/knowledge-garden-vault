> **Learning Philosophy**: Every broken thing teaches you how systems actually work

## Key Discoveries

### Android Display Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Rayneo Air 3S Pro glasses triggered OnePlus desktop mode instead of simple video mirroring
**Root Cause**: OnePlus automatically switches to desktop mode when external display detected
**Solution Strategy**: 
- Research device-specific compatibility before purchase
- Test return policies for hardware incompatibilities  
- Alternative: Use dedicated streaming devices for better compatibility

**Lesson**: Compatibility isn't guaranteed even with "universal" standards like USB-C DisplayPort

### Resume/CV Optimization Challenges  
**Problem**: ATS systems rejected applications despite relevant experience
**Root Cause**: Missing keywords, poor formatting, buried achievements
**Solution Process**:
1. **Audit current content** - identify what's missing
2. **Research target roles** - extract exact keywords from job descriptions
3. **Quantify achievements** - numbers beat vague descriptions
4. **Format for ATS** - avoid tables, graphics, unusual formatting

**Key Insight**: Your experience matters less than how you present it to both humans and machines

## Problem-Solving Framework

### The Systematic Approach
```
1. Define the actual problem (not symptoms)
2. Research if others have solved this
3. Test smallest possible change first  
4. Document what works/doesn't work
5. Build systematic solution from tested parts
```

### When to Research vs. Troubleshoot
- **Research first**: Hardware compatibility, software limitations
- **Troubleshoot first**: Configuration issues, user error likely
- **Do both**: Complex systems with multiple failure points

### Tools That Actually Help
- **Web search**: Use specific error messages, model numbers
- **Reddit/forums**: Real user experiences vs. marketing claims
- **Manufacturer docs**: Often buried but most accurate
- **YouTube**: Visual troubleshooting guides

## Common Patterns

### Hardware Incompatibility Red Flags
- "Universal" claims without specific device lists
- No mention of software/driver requirements
- Cheap price for premium features
- Recent product with limited reviews

### Software Configuration Issues
- Default settings optimized for average use, not your needs
- Privacy settings reset during updates
- Compatibility breaks with OS updates
- Features hidden in "advanced" menus

**Debugging Mindset**: Assume nothing, test everything, document findings.
