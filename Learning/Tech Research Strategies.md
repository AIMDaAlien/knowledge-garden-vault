> **Core Insight**: Marketing promises ≠ Real-world performance

## Research Process Evolved

### Pre-Purchase Investigation
**Rayneo Glasses Example**:
- Official specs said "universal USB-C compatibility"
- Reality: OnePlus desktop mode conflicts
- **Lesson**: Check device-specific forums, not just reviews

### Information Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Direct testing, manufacturer documentation
2. **Secondary**: Technical forums, Reddit experiences  
3. **Tertiary**: Professional reviews, YouTube demos
4. **Avoid**: Sponsored content, affiliate marketing sites

### Red Flags
- No mention of specific device compatibility
- Only positive reviews (fake review farms)
- Vague technical specifications
- Recent product with limited real user feedback

## Effective Research Tactics

### Technical Documentation
- Search for actual implementation details
- Look for protocol specifications
- Check compatibility matrices
- Find troubleshooting guides

### Community Intelligence  
**What Works**:
- r/[specific device] subreddits
- XDA forums for Android devices
- GitHub issues for open source projects
- Manufacturer support forums

**What Doesn't**:
- Amazon reviews (easily faked)
- Tech blog aggregation sites
- Social media influencer opinions

### Verification Methods
```
1. Multiple source confirmation
2. Technical specification cross-reference
3. Real user experience sampling
4. Edge case scenario research
```

## Research Lessons

### Privacy Tool Evaluation
- Open source ≠ automatically trustworthy
- Audit recent code changes and maintainer activity
- Check funding sources and business models
- Verify claims with independent testing

### Hardware Compatibility
- Check specific OS version compatibility
- Verify driver availability and update frequency
- Research long-term support commitments

**Research Rule**: Spend research time proportional to purchase cost and replacement difficulty.
