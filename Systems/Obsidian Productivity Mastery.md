## Powerful Search Techniques

### Basic Search
```
Simple text search:
programming python

Case sensitive:
match-case:Python

Exact phrase:
"machine learning algorithms"
```

### Advanced Search Operators
```
📁 Path-based search:
path:Career/                    # All career notes
path:"Programming/"             # Notes in Programming folder

🏷️ Tag-based search:
tag:#programming               # Notes with programming tag
tag:#beginner AND tag:#python  # Multiple tags

📅 Date-based search:
created:2024-01-01             # Created on specific date
modified:>2024-01-01           # Modified after date

🔍 Content search:
line:(TODO OR FIXME)           # Find action items
section:Overview               # Search in specific sections
```

### Search Combinations
```
Complex queries:
tag:#programming AND path:Python/ AND line:function
(#beginner OR #intermediate) AND file:notes
tag:#career -tag:#archived     # Career notes, not archived
```

## Note Organization System

### Folder Structure Strategy
```
📂 Top-Level Organization:
🗺️ Knowledge Base - Main Index.md    # Central navigation
📁 Programming/                      # Technical content
📁 Career/                          # Professional development  
📁 Systems/                         # Tools and processes
📁 Projects/                        # Active work
📁 Archive/                         # Completed/outdated
📁 Templates/                       # Note templates
```

### Linking Strategy
```markdown
# Different types of links:

[[Note Name]]                    # Basic internal link
[[Note Name|Display Text]]       # Link with custom text
[[Note Name#Heading]]           # Link to specific section
[[Note Name^block-id]]          # Link to specific block

# External links:
[Display Text](https://example.com)
```

### Tag Hierarchy
```
🏷️ Tag System:
#programming
  #programming/python
  #programming/web
  #programming/databases

#career
  #career/interviews
  #career/networking
  #career/skills

#project
  #project/active
  #project/completed
  #project/planning
```

```

## Advanced Features

### Dataview Queries
```javascript
// List all programming notes modified this week
```dataview
LIST
FROM #programming 
WHERE file.mtime >= date(today) - dur(7 days)
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

// Create project dashboard
```dataview
TABLE status, deadline, priority
FROM #project/active 
SORT priority DESC, deadline ASC
```

// Track learning progress
```dataview
LIST
FROM #learning
WHERE contains(tags, "completed")
GROUP BY dateformat(file.ctime, "yyyy-MM")
```
```

### Graph View Optimization
```
🕸️ Graph Settings:
• Color groups by tags or folders
• Adjust forces for better layout
• Filter out noise (daily notes, etc.)
• Focus on specific tag clusters
• Use local graph for note context
```

### Automation Ideas
```python
# Python script to process Obsidian notes
import os
import re
from pathlib import Path

def update_backlinks():
    """Find and update broken internal links"""
    vault_path = Path("~/Documents/Obsidian/MyVault").expanduser()
    
    for note_file in vault_path.rglob("*.md"):
        with open(note_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Find all [[links]]
        links = re.findall(r'\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]', content)
        
        for link in links:
            # Check if linked file exists
            linked_file = vault_path / f"{link}.md"
            if not linked_file.exists():
                print(f"Broken link: {link} in {note_file.name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    update_backlinks()
```

## Backup and Sync

### Backup Strategy
```
💾 Multi-layered Backup:
1. Git repository (version control)
2. Cloud sync (Obsidian Sync or Dropbox)
3. Local backup (Time Machine, File History)
4. Export backup (regular vault exports)
```

### Git Integration
```bash
# Initialize Git repository in vault
cd /path/to/obsidian/vault
git init
echo ".obsidian/workspace*" >> .gitignore
echo ".obsidian/hotkeys.json" >> .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Initial vault setup"

# Daily backup script
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/obsidian/vault
git add .
git commit -m "Daily backup $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Optimization
```
⚡ Speed Up Obsidian:
• Limit auto-complete suggestions
• Reduce graph animation
• Disable unused plugins
• Index only essential folders
• Use smaller image files
• Regular cache clearing
```

### Organization Problems
```
🧹 Maintaining Clean Vault:
• Regular tag cleanup and standardization
• Delete orphaned notes (notes with no links)
• Merge duplicate content
• Use MOCs to prevent note sprawl
• Establish naming conventions early
```

### Link Management
```
🔗 Keeping Links Healthy:
• Use "Unlinked mentions" to find connection opportunities
• Regular broken link audits
• Consistent note naming conventions
• Avoid special characters in note names
• Use aliases for alternative note names
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Mobile-Friendly Practices
- **Shorter note names** - Easier to type on mobile
- **Simple formatting** - Complex tables don't work well
- **Voice notes** - Quick capture using voice-to-text
- **Offline access** - Ensure sync works without internet

## Obsidian as Learning Tool

### Spaced Repetition
```markdown
# Create review cards
What is the time complexity of binary search? #review
?
O(log n) - eliminates half the search space each iteration

# Use review plugin to schedule spaced repetition
```

### Progressive Summarization
```markdown
# Original capture (Level 1)
Raw notes from book/article/lecture

## Key insights (Level 2 - Bold)
**Important concepts and ideas**

### Core principles (Level 3 - Highlight)  
==Essential knowledge that must be remembered==

#### Action items (Level 4 - Personal notes)
- How I'll apply this knowledge
- Questions for further research
```

Your Obsidian vault should become an extension of your thinking. The more you invest in organizing and connecting your knowledge, the more valuable it becomes as your personal 知識データベース (ちしきデータベース - knowledge database)!
