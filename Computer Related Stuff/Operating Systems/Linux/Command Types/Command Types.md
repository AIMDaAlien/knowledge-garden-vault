A way to learn more about a cmd is to look at its origins. The `type` cmd can be used to determine info about cmd type.

`type cmd ` 

There are several different sources of cmds within the shell of your CLI including *[[Internal Commands]], [[External Commands]], [[Aliases]], and [[Functions]].*

`type cd`       -->    `cd is a shell builtin `
