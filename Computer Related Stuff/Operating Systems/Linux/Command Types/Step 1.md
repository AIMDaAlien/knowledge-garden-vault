`type command`

[[Internal Commands]] are built into the shell itself. A good example is `cd` as it is a part of the [[Bash]] shell. When a user ty[es the `cd` cmd, the bash shell is already executing and knows how to interpret it, without needing additional programs.

The `type` cmd identifies the `cd` cmd as an internal command.
