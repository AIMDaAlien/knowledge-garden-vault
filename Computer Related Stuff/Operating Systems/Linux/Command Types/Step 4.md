The final cmd type is *executable program*. These cmds invoke programs installed on the system which perform specific tasks. When a user types the `vi` cmd, the shell uses the `PATH` file to locate and execute the program. 
Other programs like `vlc` (open source media player), are installed by users or admins for specific purposes and not be listed in PATH unless installed separately. 
```
type vi
cd /bin
type vlc
cd
```
