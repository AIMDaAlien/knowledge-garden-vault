#### Benefits
- When making a large number of files available, such as the source code to an application or a collection of documents, it is easier for people to download a compressed archive than it is to download files individually.
- Log files have a habit of filling disks, so it is helpful to split them by date and compress older versions.

The *compression algorithm* is a procedure the computer uses to encode the original file, making it smaller. There are two types: 
- **Lossless** -- No information is removed from the file. Compressing a file and decompressing it leaves something identical to the original.
- **Lossy** -- Information might be removed from a file. Its compressed in a way that uncompressing a file will result in a  file that is slightly different from the original. Most noticeable in high res images
