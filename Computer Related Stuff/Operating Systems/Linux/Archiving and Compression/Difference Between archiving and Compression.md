**[[Archiving]]** -- Combines multiple files into one, which reduces the overhead in individual files and makes the files easier to transmit.

**[[Compression]]** -- Makes the files smaller by removing redundant information


*Files can be compressed individually, or multiple files can be combined into a single archive and then subsequently compressed. The latter is still referred to as archiving.*
