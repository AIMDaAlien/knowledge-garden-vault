To view the history list of a terminal, use `history` [[Computer Related Stuff/Operating Systems/Linux/Command HIstory/Step 1]]
If the command is in the list that `history` generates, it can be executed by typing ! And the number next to the command. 

For example, to execute the third to last command
 `!3`


If the `history` command uses a number as an argument, it outputs that number of previous commands from the history list.

For example, to show last four commands:
`history 4`  [[Computer Related Stuff/Operating Systems/Linux/Command HIstory/Step 2]]


To execute the *nth* command from the bottom of the history list, type `!-n` .

For example, to execute the fifth from the bottom,
`!-5` [[Computer Related Stuff/Operating Systems/Linux/Command HIstory/Step 3]]

To execute the most recent command, press `!!`

To execute the most recent iteration of a specific command, type ! Followed by the command
