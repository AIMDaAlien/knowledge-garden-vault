Once a user has entered a command, the terminal then accepts what the user has typed and passes it to a *shell*.  The shell is the command line interpreter that translates commands entered by a user into actions to be performed by the operating system. 

The Linux environment allows the use of many different shells, some of which have been around for many years. The most common, [[Bash]] provides many advanced features, such as command history and inline editing -- allowing users to re-execute previously executed [[Commands]] or a variation of them via simple editing. 



The prompt shown contains the following info:

The [[~ Home Directory]] is under the */home* directory and named after the user account name. Ex: /home/AIM .
