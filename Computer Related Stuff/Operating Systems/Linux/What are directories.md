It can be described as a file that stores the file names and the related info. Every file whether ordinary, special, or directory  are contained in directories. The tree has a single root node, the slash character ( / ), and all other directories are contained below it.

A directory can contain other directories, giving rise to hierarchical structure, and this organization of files is called **Linux File system tree**

The entire Linux file system follows a tree structure, thus there are no partitions on your hard drive. Everything on the system can be accessed in one large tree structure.
