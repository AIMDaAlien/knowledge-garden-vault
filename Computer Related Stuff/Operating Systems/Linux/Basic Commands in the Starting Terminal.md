-  `clear` or  *ctrl+l*  -- to clear everything

- `touch file1.txt ` -- to create a file 

- `cat file1.txt` -- concatenates (reads out the file contents) 

- `mkdir` [[Directories inside Linux file system]]

-  the *tab* button will autocomplete what you want to type out

- `rm -rf  filename` -- to remove forcefully any directory or file since rmdir will only remove empty directories
