The documentation is shown in nodes, and in the example, the stuff highlighted shows its currently in the `ls invocation` node.

###  [[Navigating Info Nodes]]  

First line gives index info about current location within doc. 
Next node would be `dir invocation` much like a book.
Going up a level is `Directory listing`. 

Scrolling through the doc, notice menu for `ls`
![[Pasted image 20230611182328.png]]
The items under the menu are hyperlinks that link to nodes that describe `ls`.  
Placing the cursor on the line * Sorting the output: :  and pressing enter leads to a node that describes sorting the output of `ls`

**Note:
Going into the node about sorting leads into a sub-node of the original. To go back to the previous node, use U. while U leads to the start of the node a level up, L returns to the same location as before entering the sorting mode.
