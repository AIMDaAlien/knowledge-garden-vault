[[Man Pages]] are good sources, but tend to have some disadvantages. One example being that each man page is a separate doc, not related to any other man page. While some have `SEE ALSO`Â section, they tend to be independent sources of documentation.

`info` also provides documentation on OS cmds and features in a logical oranizational structure, making it more readable. 

All documentation is merged into a single "book" representing all documentation available. Within info docs, info is broken down into categories that work like a table of contents. Hyperlinks are given to pages with info on specific topics for a cmd or feature. 

Another advantage of info is the writing style is almost like learning a topic. 

Consider man pages as reference resource and info docs as learning guide.
