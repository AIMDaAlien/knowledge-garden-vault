The Bash shell has other features:

- **Scripting**:  The ability to place commands in a file and then interpret (effectively use bash to execute file contents of) file, resulting in all commands being executed. This feature also has programming features such as [[Conditional Logic]] and create functions.

- **[[Aliases]]:** The ability to create short nicknames for longer commands.

- **Variables** ([[Path Variable]] , [[Local Variables]], [[Environment Variables]]):  Used to store info for the Bash shell and user. These variables can be used to modify how commands and features work and provide vital system info.


These are some of its capabilities.
