Under this /home directory there is a directory for each user on the system. The dirextory name is the same as the name of the user, so a user named `weewee` would have a home directory called `/home/weewee`.

The home directory is one of the few directories where the user has full control to create and delete additional files and directories. 

You could also refer to another user's home directory by using ~ followed by the name of the user account.
