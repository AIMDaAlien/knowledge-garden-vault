Everything in Linux is a file.

To change perms, you use [[chmod]]. 
Possible options here are ***u*** for user, ***g*** for the group, ***o***  for others, and *a* for all three. If none are specified, default will be all.

After that, you specify the perms to add or remove with *+* or *-* . 

Linux protects your files by giving them different levels of access. To handle data access, linux uses **ownership**. 

Your file is accessed only by the specified users, or groups, using the [[chown]](change owners) cmd.
