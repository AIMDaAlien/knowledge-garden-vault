When the [[ls]] cmd is used to show the contents of a directory, not all files are shown usually (it omits hidden files by default). A hidden file is any file that starts with a . 

To show all files, including hidden, use `-a` with `ls`

Most hidden files are customization files, designed to customize Linux, the shell or how programs work. 
Normally you wont be needing to know it.
