When `-d` is used with [[ls]] , it refers to the current directory, and not the contents within it. Without other options, its rather meaningless. Recall that the current directory is always referred to with [[The . Char]].

 In this case, `-l`  shows the details of the contents in /home/sysadmin directory:

Note the single period at the end of the long listing. This indicates that the current directory is being listed, and not the contents.
