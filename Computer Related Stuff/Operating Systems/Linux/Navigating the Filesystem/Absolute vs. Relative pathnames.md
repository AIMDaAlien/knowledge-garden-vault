Suppose you are in the `/usr/share/doc` directory and you want to go to the `/usr/share/doc/bash` directory. Typing the command `cd /usr/share/doc/bash` results in a fair amount of typing. In cases like this, you want to use [[Relative Paths]].

**Note:**  If there wasn't a bash directory under the current directory, the cmd would fail.
