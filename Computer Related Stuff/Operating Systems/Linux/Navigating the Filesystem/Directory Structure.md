On windows, the *top level*  of the directory structure is called *My Computer*. Physical devices, such as hard drives or network drives, show up under My computer and are each assigned a drive letter such as C: or D:

Like Windows, the Linux directory structure, typically called a *filesystem*, also has a top level. However, My Computer is actually [[root directory]], sybolized as a slash /. 
Theres also no drives in Linux; each physical drive is accessible under a directory rather than a drive letter.
