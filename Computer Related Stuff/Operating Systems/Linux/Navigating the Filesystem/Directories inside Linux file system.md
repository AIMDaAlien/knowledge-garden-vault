At the top, there is the **/directory**.  [[What are directories]]

Under that root directorate, there’s more directories which are said to be subdirectories of the root. Simply called **“parent”** directories.

The [[~ Home Directory]] holds individual directories for each of the different regular users on the system.

Then there’s the **bin directory** which stores common Linux user command binaries, Bain binaries, which is where Bin gets its name from.

In the binary folder, you’ve got the boot folder. The boot has everything that’s required for the system to boot with such as the Linux kernel and bootloader configs.

The dev folder contains files representing devices.
