`h1` to `h6` heading elements are used to shoe the importance f content below them. The lower the number, the higher its importance, so `h2` is less important than `h1`. Only one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher ones. 

Below the `h1` element, add an `h2` element with the text:
`Cat Photos`

```html
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>CatÂ Photos</h2>
```
