Noticew that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make be able to select only one button, both buttons must have a `name` atribute with the same value.

Add `name` with the value `indoor-outdoor` to both radio buttons.

```html 
          <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>

          <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
```
