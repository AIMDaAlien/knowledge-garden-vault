To prevent a user from submitting your form when required info is missing, you need to add the `required` attribute to an `input` element. Theres no need to set avalue to `required`. Instead, just add the word `required` to the `input` element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

```html
<input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
```
