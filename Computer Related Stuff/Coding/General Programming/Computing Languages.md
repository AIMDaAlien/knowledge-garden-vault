High level programming languages are somewhat similar to natural ones where they use symbols, words and conventions readable to humans. These languages enable humans to express cmds to computers that are much more complex than those offered by IL's (instruction list).

A program written in a high level language is called a [[Source Code]]. The file containing the source code is called the source file. 


Such a composition has to be correct in many senses:

- **alphabetically** – a program needs to be written in a recognizable script, such as Roman, Cyrillic, etc.
- **lexically** – each programming language has its dictionary and you need to master it; thankfully, it's much simpler and smaller than the dictionary of any natural language;
- **syntactically** – each language has its rules and they must be obeyed;
- **semantically** – the program has to make sense.


There are two different ways of **transforming a program from a high-level programming language into machine language**:

[[Compilation]]

[[Interpretation]]


There are very few languages that can be both compiled and interpreted. Usually, a programming language is projected with this factor in its constructors' minds – will it be compiled or interpreted?
