##### The source program is translated once (however it must be repeated each time you modify [[Source Code]]). By getting a file containing the machine code.  Now you can distribute the file worldwide.

*The program that performs translation is called a **compiler** or **translator**. 


## Advantages 

- **The execution of translated code is faster

- **Only the user has to have the compiler** -- the end user wont need it 

- **translated code is stored in machine language**-- your inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret


## Disadvantages

- **The compilation itself is time consuming and cant run code immediately after making amendments**

- **Must have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to run on**
