##### User of the code can translate the source program each time it has to be run. The program performing this kind of transformation is called **interpreter**, as it interprets code every time its executed. It also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as is, because the end user also needs the interpreter to execute it. 

The interpreter will inform you where the error is located and what caused it (but it may be misleading). 


## Advantages

- **You can run the code as soon as you complete it
- **The code is stored using programming language, not machine language** - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.


## Disadvantages

- **Interpretation isn't very fast compared to [[Compilation]]
- **You and the user have to have the interpreter to run your code


*Due to historical reasons, languages designed to be utilized in the interpretation manner are often called **scripting languages**, while the source programs encoded using them are called **scripts**.
