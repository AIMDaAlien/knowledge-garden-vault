Python has a vast ecosystem of livraries and mofules that extend its functionality. You can umport these libraries into your code and use their prebuilt functions and classes. For example, the `random` module allows you to generate random numbers


Import random

Num = random.Randint (1, 10)
Print ("Random number: ", num)


This code imports the `random` module and generates a random number between 1 and 10.
