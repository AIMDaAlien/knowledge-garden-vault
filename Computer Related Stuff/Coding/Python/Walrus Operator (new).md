Walrus operator is another name for assignment expression in python. 
According to the official documentation, its a way to assign to variables within an expression using the notation NAME := expression. 

{Basically you can assign variables and [[Print Function]] them out more efficiently in one line!!}
For example: 

```python
``` # using assignment operator
Variable=False 
Print (variable)

 # using Walrus operator
Print (variable:=False)
