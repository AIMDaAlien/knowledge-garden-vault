Functions can return values, allowing you to perform operations and retrieve results from a function call. Example:


``def add_numbers (x, y):
    Return x + y

Result = add_numbers (3, 4)
Print (result)  # Output: 7



In this code, the `add_numbers()` function takes two parameters and returns their sum. The result is then stored in the `result` variable and then printed.
