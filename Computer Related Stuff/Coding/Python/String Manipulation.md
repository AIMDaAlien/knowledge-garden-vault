Python provides various methods for manipulating strings. You can concatenate strings, find their length, convert cases and more. Example:


Message = "Hello, World!"

Print (len (message))          # Output: 13
Print (message.Upper ())       # Output: "HELLO, WORLD!"
Print (message.Lower ())       # Output: "hello, world!"
Print (message.Startswith ("Hello"))  # Output: True



These methods allow you to perform operations on strings and extract useful info.
