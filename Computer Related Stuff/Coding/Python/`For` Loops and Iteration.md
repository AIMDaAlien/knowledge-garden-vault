`for` loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list. You can perform operations on each element within the loop. Here's an example:


`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

`for fruit in fruits:
    `print (fruit)



This code will iterate over each element in the `fruits ` list and print them one by one.
