Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

The two main types of loops in python are `for` and  `while ` . Example:  

`For i in range (5):
  ``  Print (i) 


This will print the numbers 0 to 4 on separate lines. The `range(5)`  function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 which then the loop then iterates over.
