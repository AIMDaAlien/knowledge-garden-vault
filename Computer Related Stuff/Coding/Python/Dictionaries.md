These store key-value pairs allow you to quickly access values based on their associated keys. Here's an example:


`student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 12,
    "grade": 7
}

Print (student["name"])   # Output: "Alice"
Print (student["age"])    # Output: 12
Print (student["grade"])  # Output: 7


Dictionaries provide a convenient way to store and retrieve data based on descriptive keys.
