Python provides functionality for reading from and writing to files. Here's an example of reading from a file:



File = open ("data. Txt", "r")  # Open the file in read mode

For line in file:
    Print (line)

File.Close ()  # Close the file after reading



In this code we open a file called "data. Txt" in read mode using the `open()` finction. We then use a aloop to read and print each line in the file.
