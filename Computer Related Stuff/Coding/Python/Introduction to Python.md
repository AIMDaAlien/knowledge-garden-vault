Replit is a tool to build and run python code. Replit is an integrated development environment, or [[IDE]] for short. IDEs can be helpful when programming for offering a user friendly working environment for programmers. 

{The alternative to using and IDE is to work directly in the CLI [[CS50 Linux (CLI)]].}

There are many IDEs to choose from -- such as Visual Studio Code, Pycharm and Komodo. Replit is a free tool that will allow you to create projects with very little setup. 

The first thing to learn with python is [[Functions in Python]] which are bits of code that perform a specific task. 

(There are currently 69 built-in functions in Python, but we'll focus on two commonly used functions: [[Print Function]] and [[Python User Input]])
