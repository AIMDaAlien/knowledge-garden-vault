**All values are stored in computer memory sort of like a long list of storage locations each having a number called a  memory address. They are usually prefixed with x (x 201). 

Programs need a way to keep track of these values. They do what's called variables. Python keeps track of variables which is a named location in memory. Pythion keeps track of variables in a separate area of memory from the values. We might have a variable *paul_age*  whose value was 44. We do this by storing memory address x 35 with variable paul_age. 

Typically, we will write memory addresses as a number with an "id" as a prefix to distinguish them from other numbers (for example, `id201` is memory address 201).

You wont need to keep track of where or which memory address gets used. 

***A value has a memory address
A variable contains memory address and refers or points to a value
