Another type of [[Loops in Python]]  is the `while` loop which repeats a block of code as long as a [[Conditional Logic]] remains true. Example:


```python
```Count = 0

While count < 5:
    Print (count)
    Count += 1


#This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 4 incrementing the `count` variable by 1 in each iteration.
