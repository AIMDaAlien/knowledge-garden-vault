- #### Creating a variable 
    You need to specify the data type of the variable and give it a name.
    
    [[int]] number; 
    [[char]] letter;

- If you want to create multiple variables of the same type, you specify the type name *once*, and then list however many variables of that type.
     
     Int height, width;
     [[float]] sqrt2, sqrt3, pi;

- In general, its good practice to only *declare*  variables when you need them.


- #### Using a Variable
    After a variable has been declared, you don't need to specify the type.
    
    Int number;
    Number = 17;
    Char letter; 
    Letter = 'H';

 - If youre both declaring and setting the value of a variable, you can consolidate this to one step.
     Int number = 17;
     Char letter = 'H';
