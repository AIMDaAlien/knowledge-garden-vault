##### int
- Used for variables that store integers
- Integers always use up 4 bytes of memory (32 bits). This means the range of values they can store is limited to 32 bits of info.

- It was decided that half possible values could be negative or positive
     ###### unsigned int
     - Unsigned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types (including int), which effectively doubles the positive range of the type at the cost of not allowing negative values.
     - Occasionally used in CS50.
