1. Start out how you'd create any html webpage:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en">
   </html>
```

2. Nest a `head` element within the `html` element. Just after the `head` element, add a body element.
```html
<head>
  </head>
  <body> 
</body>
```

3.  Remember the `title` element gives search engines extra info about the page. It also shows the content of that `title` element in two more ways:
- In the title bar when page is open
- In the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab isnt open, once you hover on the tab, the `title` text is displayed.
Within the `head` element, nest a title element with the text `Colored Markers`
```html
  <head>
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
</head>
```
