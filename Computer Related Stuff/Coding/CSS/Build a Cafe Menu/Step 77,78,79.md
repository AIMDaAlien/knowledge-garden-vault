77. Next you are going to be styling the `footer` element. To keep the CSS organized, add a comment at the end of `styles.css` with the text `FOOTER`.
```css
/*FOOTER*/
```

78. Moving down to the footer, make all the text have a value of `14px` for the font size.
```css
footer { 
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

79. The default color of a link that has not yet been clicked on is typically blue. The default color of a link that has already been visited from a page is typically purple.

To make the `footer` links the same color regardless if a link has been visited, use a type selector for the anchor element (`a`) and use the value `black` for the `color` property.
```css
 a {
color: black;
}
```
