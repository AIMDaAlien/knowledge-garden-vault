32. The flavors and prices are currently stacked each other and centered. It'd be nice if the flavor was on the left and price on the right.

Add the class name `flavor` to the `French Vanilla` `p` element.
```html
<p class="flavor"> French Vanilla</p>

            <p>3.00</p>
```


33. Using your new `flavor` class as a selector, set the `text-align` property's value to `left`. 
```css
.flavor {
  text-align: left;
}
```


34. Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named `price` to  your `p` element that has `3.00` as its text.
```html
<p class="price">3.00</p>
```


35. Now align the text to the `right` for the elements with the `price` class.
```css
.price {text-align: right;}
```
