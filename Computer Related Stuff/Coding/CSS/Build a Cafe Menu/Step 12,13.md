12. In the previous step [[Step 10,11]], you used a *type selector* to style the `h1` element. Center the `h2` and `p` by adding a new type selector for each one to the existing `style` element.

```css
    <style>

      h1 {text-align: center}

      h2 {text-align: center}

      p {text-align: center}

    </style>
```



13. You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:

Delete the existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that senters the text for `h1,h2, and p`.

```css
    <style>

      h1, h2, p {text-align: center}

    </style>
```
