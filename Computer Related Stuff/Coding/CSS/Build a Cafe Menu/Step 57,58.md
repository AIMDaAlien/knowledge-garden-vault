57. You can change the `font-family` of text, to make it look different from the default font of your browser. Each browser has some common fonts available to it.
Change all the text in your body by adding a `font-family` property with the value `sans-serif`. This is a common readable font.

```css
body { font-family: sans-serif;
background-image: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg);
}
```


58. Kinda boring to have it all the same font. 

Style both the h1 and h2 elements so that only these elements' text use `Impact` font.

```css
  h1, h2 {
 font-family: Impact;
}
```
