Since the cafe's main product for sale is coffee, you could use an image of coffee beans for the background of the page.

Delete the comment and its contents inside the `body` type selector. Now add a `background-image` property and set its value to `url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg)`.

```css
body { background-image: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg)
}
```

29. Time to start adding menu items.
Add an empty `article` element under the `Coffee` heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer. 

```css
          <h2>Coffee</h2>

          <article> </article>
```


30. `article` elements commonly contain multiple element that have related info. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for tha flavor.
Nest two `p` elements inside your `article` element. The first one's text should be `French Vanilla`, and the second's text  `3.00`.

```css
          <article>

            <p>French Vanilla</p>

            <p>3.00</p>

          </article>
```
