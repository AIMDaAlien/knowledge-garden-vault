14. You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the `style` tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, its best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.

We created a separate `styles.css` file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

Start by rewriting the styles you had created into `styles.css` file. Exclude the opening and closing style tags.

```css
      h1, h2, p {

        text-align: center;

      }
```


15.  Remove the `style` element and all its contents. Once removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left. 

```css
  <head>

    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <title>Cafe Menu</title>

   </head>
   ```
