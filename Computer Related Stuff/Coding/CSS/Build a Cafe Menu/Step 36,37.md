36. That's what you want but now it'd be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. `p` elements are *block level* elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the `p` elements so they behave more like *inline* elements. To do that, start by adding a `class` element under the `Coffee` heading.

```html
          <h2>Coffee</h2>

          <article class="item">

            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>

            <p class="price">3.00</p>

          </article>
```


37. The p elements are nested in article elements with the class attribute of `item`. You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named `item` like this:
	  ![[Pasted image 20230619090928.png]]
Using the above selector, add a `display` property with value `inline-block` so the p elements behave more like online elements. 
```css
.item p { display: inline-block}
```
