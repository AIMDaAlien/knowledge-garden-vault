38. Closer, but the prices didnt stay over on the right. This is because `inline-block` elements only take up the width of their content. To spread them out, add a `width` property to the `flavor` and price class selectors that have a value of `%50` each.

```css
.flavor { width: 50%;
  text-align: left;
}

.price { width: 50%;
  text-align: right;
}
```

39. Aw that didnt work. Styling p elements as `inline-block` and placing them on separate lines in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line. One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than `50%`. 
Change the width value to `40%` for each class to see what happens.

```css
.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 49%;
}

.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 49%;
}
```
