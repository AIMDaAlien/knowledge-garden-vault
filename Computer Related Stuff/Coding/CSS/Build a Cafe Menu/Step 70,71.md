Notice how the thickness of the line looks bigger? The default value of a property named `border-width` is `1px` for all edges of `hr` elements. By changing the border to the same color as the background, the total height of the line is `5px` (`3px` + top and bottom border width of `1px`).

Change the `height` property of the `hr` to be `2px`, so the total height of it becomes `4px`.

```css
hr {
  height: 2px;
  background-color: brown;
  border-color: brown;
}
```


71. Add another header between `main` element and the `footer` element. 

```html
</main>
<hr>
<footer>
```
