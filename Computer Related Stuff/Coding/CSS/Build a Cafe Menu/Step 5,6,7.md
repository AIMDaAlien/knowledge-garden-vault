5. Time to add come menu content. Add a `main` element within the existing `body` element. It will eventually contain pricing info about coffee and desserts offered by the café.

```css
  <body>

    <main></main>

  </body>
```


6.  The name of the cafe is "CAMPER CAFE". Add an `h1` element within your `main` element. Give it the name of the cafe in capitalized letters to make it stand out.

```css
    <main>

      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>

    </main>
```


7. To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a `p` element below the `h1` element with the text `Est. 2020`.

```css
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>

      <p>Est. 2020</p>
```
