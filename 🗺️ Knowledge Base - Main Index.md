## 💡 **Learning Philosophy**

> **連鎖学習 (れんさがくしゅう - "chain learning")**: Each topic builds on the previous, creating strong knowledge connections.

### Effective Study Pattern
1. **Read** the foundational concepts
2. **Practice** with hands-on examples  
3. **Build** small projects applying the knowledge
4. **Teach** by explaining to others (or rubber duck!)
5. **Connect** new learning to existing knowledge
