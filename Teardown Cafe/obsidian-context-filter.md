# ðŸ”— Obsidian Context Filter for Teardown Cafe

## Quick Context Setup

### Method 1: Tag-Based Filtering (Recommended)
Add this tag to relevant notes: `#teardown-cafe`

**In Obsidian:**
1. Open any note related to your teardown project
2. Add `#teardown-cafe` at the bottom
3. Use Obsidian's tag pane to see all tagged notes

### Method 2: Folder Structure
Create a dedicated folder: `Teardown Cafe/`

**Structure:**
```
Obsidian Vault/
â”œâ”€â”€ Teardown Cafe/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Project Overview.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Design System Notes.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Content Strategy.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Technical Decisions.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Workflow Notes.md
```

### Method 3: MOC (Map of Content)
Create a master note: `Teardown Cafe MOC.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
